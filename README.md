## AVIF & WebP - What is that?

AVIF is a brand new and cutting edge image format developed by Alliance for Open Media (AOMedia) which is backed by e. g. Google, Facebook, Apple, Netflix, Microsoft, Amazon ... to name just a few.
It is based on AOMedia Video 1 (AV1) codec which is being used e. g. by Netflix.
With its super-modern compression algorithm AVIF provides the smallest possible image file sizes as of today.<br>
WebP is a next-generation file format for images developed by Google.
It provides significantly reduced file sizes compared to JPG/PNG while maintaining the same quality, thanks to its advanced and powerful compression algorithm.
